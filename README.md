## GitHub:
Welcome to the Alt Zone game projects UX/UI “swimming lanes”.  Here, we give and take assignments relating the UX/UI of the webpage and the mobile game.  As you can see, there are separate “lanes” for different sections of the project. Carefully follow the ones that apply to you.

You can add new issues (aka. to do tasks) and claim them for yourself.  This means you accept the task and are going to complete it. Give the task a well descriptive title and a brief description. Use English if possible. If you have difficulties with this, you can always ask for help.

If you’re unable to complete the task, you can transfer it to the “unfinished” section and describe where you have left it so others know where to continue.

Once the task is done, close it and move it to the “done” section.



## GitHub Desktop:
We use and save resources to repositories.
Download the GitHub Desktop following the steps mentioned in the info page pinned comments in Discord.
We use Altzone and GrafiikkaWeb repositories.
If you need help on how to set this up and how to use it, feel free to ask help from *Helena (psykkis) or 
*C-NettiLead Joni or other UX/UI team mates.



## Figma:
Here’s the link to the Figma file:

In Figma we have different pages for the design system, the webpages and the mobile game. 

Work in your designated area and try to keep it organized so in the case where your work is left unfinished, it is easy for the next one to continue.

We use English as the main communication language, but the content language of the website is Finnish.

Use the design system! There we have specified the basic styles like: typography, colours, spacing, corner radius, line styles and shadows. The design system evolves as we design the website and the game so familiarize yourself with it. You can also update it when needed. If you are unsure how to use or update it, ask for help from other UX/UI team mates.

Other things that are essential to use in this project:

- Design tokens (as you “assign” a design token, for example to a colour, it automatically changes to everywhere it is assigned if the token is updated)
- Assets -> components (it is easier to modify the mother component than everything individually -> the changes are updated to all used components)
- Grid styles (helps to keep everything in line throughout the different sites [see also the screen space usage guide, the colorful one on the design system])
- Autolayout (ensures consistency and reduces manual adjustments. Allows elements to adapt dynamically to changes in content)

If you don’t know how or are unsure how to use these, you can always ask for help from other UX/UI team mates.
